## Resources
This project consists of 3 repositories:
- The core [library's repository](https://github.com/LadyMalande/RDFtoCSV) containing the implementation of the converter
- The [command line app's repository](https://github.com/LadyMalande/RDFtoCSVApplication) that is runnable in a command line
- This [website client's repository](https://github.com/LadyMalande/rdf-to-csv.github.io) where you can try out the converter live


All repositories are public after the thesis has been concluded.

If you wish to contribute to any of the repositories, do not hesitate to submit your contribution and make a pull request! 

When I have a spare moment in the future, I will review them and possibly merge them for future use for other people.

The text of the theis is available on the [(CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE) official university website for student's works](). As of now, the text is only available in Czech language. 

If an English version is ever published, it will have a separate link as the work will be translated in my free time after the thesis is concluded.
